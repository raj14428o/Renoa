## About

**Renoa** is a full-stack social blogging and networking platform focused on **security, ownership, and real-time interaction**.  
Users can publish blogs, interact through real-time comments, follow creators, and communicate privately using **device-based end-to-end encrypted messaging**.

The platform enforces strict authentication and authorization rules while maintaining a clean and intuitive user experience.

---

## 🌐 Live Demo

**Renoa App:** https://renoa.app

---

## Features Overview

## Authentication & Security

> Designed with a security-first approach

- User registration with **email verification via OTP**
- OTPs are **bcrypt-hashed** and time-bound
- Passwords stored using **SHA-256 with salting**
- JWT-based authentication for protected routes
- Mandatory re-verification on email change
- Secure password recovery using OTP verification

---

## 👥 Access Control Model

### ✔ Authenticated Users
- Create, edit, and delete blogs
- Upload blog cover images
- Write content using **Markdown**
- Comment on blogs (real time)
- Edit profile information
- Follow users
- Send and receive encrypted messages

### 👀 Public Visitors
- View blogs
- Read comments

**Restricted for public users:**
- No commenting
- No profile access
- No following
- No private messaging

---

## 📝 Blogging System

- Rich blog editor with:
  - Title
  - Cover image
  - Markdown-supported content

---

## 👤 User Profiles

- Displays user information and authored blogs
- Profile owners can update personal details
- Other users can:
  - Follow / unfollow
  - Initiate private messaging

---

## 🔒 Encrypted Private Messaging

> Device-based end-to-end encryption

- Private keys are generated **only when visiting `/messages`**
- Each device creates a **unique private key per user**
- Keys are securely stored using **IndexedDB**
- Messages can be sent to users who have never opened `/messages`

### Device Behavior

- Messages are readable **only on the originating device**
- Logging in from a new device:
  - Generates a new private key
  - Makes previous encrypted messages inaccessible
  - Starts a fresh encrypted session
- Multiple user accounts supported on a single device

---

## 💬 Messaging Capabilities

- Real-time messaging
- Message sent & seen status
- Online / offline presence
- Last seen tracking
- Client-side decryption for privacy

---

## Deployment

- Deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- Runs on a **single EC2 instance**
- Application is exposed using the instance **public IP address**
- **Cloudflare** is used for:
  - DNS management for `renoa.app`
  - SSL/TLS certificate provisioning
- Domain is linked to the EC2 instance IP via Cloudflare DNS
- HTTPS is enforced through Cloudflare’s SSL layer

---

## 🛡️ Security Highlights

- OTP-based email ownership verification
- Hashed OTP storage (bcrypt)
- Salted password hashing (SHA-256)
- JWT-protected routes
- Client-side encryption
- Device-based key isolation
- Strict authorization checks

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT
- bcrypt
- SHA-256

### Frontend
- EJS
- Bootstrap
- Markdown parser
- IndexedDB

### Real-Time

---

## System Design

Renoa follows a **monolithic full-stack architecture** with clearly separated concerns for authentication, content management, real-time communication, and encrypted messaging.

---

### Application Architecture (High-Level)

```text
Client (Browser)
   │
   │  HTTP / WebSocket
   ▼
Node.js + Express Server
   │
   ├── Authentication & Authorization
   ├── Blog & Comment Management
   ├── Profile & Follow System
   ├── Real-Time Messaging (WebSockets)
   └── Encryption & Key Management
   │
   ▼
MongoDB (Primary Data Store)
```

---
## 🌐 Request Flow & Infrastructure Design

Renoa uses a production-oriented request flow that separates **DNS, SSL, and application hosting** to improve security and manageability.

### High-Level Request Flow

```text
Client (Browser)
   │
   │  HTTPS Request
   ▼
renoa.app (Domain)
   │
   │  DNS Resolution
   ▼
Cloudflare
   │
   ├── SSL / TLS Termination
   ├── DNS Management
   └── Secure Traffic Forwarding
   │
   ▼
AWS Elastic Beanstalk
   │
   └── EC2 Instance (Node.js + Express)
           │
           ├── API & Page Rendering
           ├── Authentication & Authorization
           ├── Real-Time Messaging
           └── Encryption Logic
           │
           ▼
        MongoDB (Primary Database)
```
---
## 🔒 Encrypted Messaging Design

Private messaging in Renoa uses **device-based end-to-end encryption** to ensure that only intended recipients can read messages.

### Encryption Workflow

```text
/messages route visited
        │
        ├── Device-specific private key generated
        ├── Private key stored in IndexedDB
        └── Public key shared with server


Sending Message
        │
        ├── Sender private key
        ├── Receiver public key
        └── Shared encryption key generated
             │
             ▼
        Encrypted message stored in database


Receiving / Decrypting Message
        │
        ├── Encrypted message fetched from database
        ├── Receiver private key (from IndexedDB)
        ├── Sender public key
        └── Shared decryption key derived
             │
             ▼
        Ciphertext decrypted on client


```
### Key Properties

- Private keys never leave the client
- Messages can't be sent if the receiver has never opened `/messages`
- Messages are readable only on the originating device
- Logging in on a new device:
  - Generates a new private key
  - Previously encrypted messages become inaccessible
  - Messaging starts fresh

----

### 🔐 Authentication Flow (System Level)
```
User Signup
   │
   ├── Register (name, email, password)
   ├── Password hashed (SHA-256 + salt)
   ├── OTP generated & bcrypt-hashed
   └── Email verification required
        │
        ▼
Verified Account → Login Allowed
        │
        ├── JWT issued
        └── Protected routes unlocked
```

- Acts as a secure entry point before AWS

---

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Hosts the Node.js application
- Manages the underlying EC2 instance
- Handles application process management
- Exposes the application via a public IP

---

### EC2 Instance
- Runs the Express server
- Handles:
  - Authentication & JWT validation
  - Blog and comment APIs
  - WebSocket connections
  - Encrypted messaging logic

---

### MongoDB
- Primary data store for:
  - Users
  - Blogs
  - Comments
  - Encrypted messages

---

##  Architectural Rationale

- **Cloudflare** simplifies DNS and SSL management
- **Elastic Beanstalk** reduces operational overhead
- A **single EC2 instance** is sufficient for the current scale
- Clear separation between network security and application logic
- Architecture is easy to extend and scale

---

## 🤔 Why This Architecture Was Chosen

- **Cloudflare** simplifies SSL and DNS management
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** reduces operational overhead
- A **single EC2 instance** is sufficient for the current scale
- Clear separation between network security and application logic
- Easy to scale vertically or horizontally in the future
---
## Scaling Considerations (Future)

- Introduce a load balancer in front of EC2 instances
- Scale horizontally with multiple EC2 instances
- Add **Redis** for caching and real-time optimizations
- Move media storage to **AWS S3**

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

```env
PORT=8000

MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string

EMAIL_USER=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password

SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

```
